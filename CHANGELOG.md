# Changelog

## B0.1 — Foundation source pass

### Visual direction
- Set rounded clouds as the active cloud style and removed the realistic-cloud, box-cloud, no-wave, no-fog, and combined no-wave/no-fog subpack choices.
- Added a subtle 3% saturation increase, slightly warmer daylight, a balanced blue sky, and a small increase in atmospheric mist.
- Retained the existing Newb lighting pipeline and shadow system while adding the community-provided RenderChunk shadow-shading snippet.

### Animation and water
- Retained gentle plant movement and reduced lantern sway.
- Disabled tree-leaf waving.
- Added a vanilla-style water path that skips shader-added water waves, custom surface reflections, and water displacement.

### Weather and performance
- Reduced rain-particle styling intensity without removing rain particles.
- Reduced rain-mist intensity.
- Kept the wet-ground effect during rain and thunderstorms while reducing its visible range and puddle intensity.

### Validation status
- Source edits are committed to main.
- A fresh artifact build has not yet been confirmed.
- Android in-game visuals, shader compatibility, and FPS performance remain unverified.
